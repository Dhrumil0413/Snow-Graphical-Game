### Snow Game Project

This repository contains my work on the Snow Game project, originally assigned by Professor Howard Hamilton at the University of Regina during the Fall 2023 semester.

#### Project Overview

The Snow Game is a graphical game implemented in C++ using the GLUT library.
The game involves a cyber babe chracter (without much of meshes and functionalities) to move through the assigned space and Map, she has the ability to move in 3d directions and jump. Also, she can create and throw the snowball in binding of laws of physics. The method of timeframe of game and its physics is at the standard rate 60 fps.
My contribution to this project focuses on following the instructions and requirements of the professor Howard Hamilton regarding the game and developing and solving the project by writing c++ code, also taking some idea about modularity of the project like which .h and .cpp files to create.

#### Professor's Libraries

This project utilizes libraries provided by Professor Howard Hamilton. These libraries, including [list the libraries], have been crucial in the development of the Snow Game. I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Hamilton for making these resources available.

#### Getting Started

##### Prerequisites

- The code runs with glut library set up.

#### Acknowledgments

- Professor Howard Hamilton for the assignment and the provided ObjLibrary and other libraries.
